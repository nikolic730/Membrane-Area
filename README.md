# Membrane-Area

Objective: The lab was trying to determine whether treating M. alcaliphilum 20Z with Cu increased membrane production.
           I created this program to measure changes in membrane production with different treatments. 


MembraneArea.m : The program measures the proportion of the intracellular space that is occupied by membrane.
                 The user selects the outline of the cell with the cursor and the inner membranes with the cursor
                 subsequently. An example image is included, Area001.TIF.
